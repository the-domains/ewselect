The Environmental industry can be as simple as a simple home or building mold remediation all the way to a complex cleanup effort. Each state, city, region requires various sets of environmental regulations which aids in sustaining the worlds fragile ecosystem. Environmental crews require hotels for their projects to ensure all other industries are keeping in line with the same standards. Environmental crews will keep the balance in ways such as:

* Industrial and Construction Storm Water Compliance
* Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reporting
* Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP)
* Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plans
* Industrial Hygiene assessments
* Health & Safety policies
* Hazardous waste minimization
* Green Energy

Lest we forget the new Green Energy sector which falls under the Environmental Industry. From Solar Power, Wind Power, Hydropower and many others these are industries which help clean and power the world. This technology is the future of power and offers much to be seen moving forward.

## Oil & Gas

In the petroleum industry there are so many needs for hotels. With projects in upstream, midstream and downstream, these crews are literally all over the world working on projects. Travel is second nature and being away from family for long periods of time is normal in this industry. From exploration of the product, to extracting it from the earth, refining it and then moving it from point A to point B or even C, D, and F, there are a lot of people involved. This industry is vast and if we tried to list all of the things that are going on right now, we would not be able to offer you this great booking tool. Instead we like to partner with others to provide information to you about what is happening in your industry. Use us as a resource so that you can always know where to go for.

## Union & Safety

Labor unions like all of our other crews have a lot of travel needs. The unions are together to collective bargain wages, benefits and working conditions.  Safety and Security also falls in the same segment with government agencies like OSHA.

## Construction & Engineering
